# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game*
*Description:* Create a game where the user plays Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer.

---

#### *Features:*

- Generate the computer's choice randomly.
- Decide the winner based on the rules:
  - Rock beats Scissors.
  - Scissors beats Paper.
  - Paper beats Rock.
- Allow the user to play multiple rounds.

#### *Code Example:*

python
import random

def rock_paper_scissors():
    print("Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!")
    print("Enter 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' to play.")
    print("Type 'exit' to quit the game.")
    
    choices = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]

    while True:
        # Get user's choice
        user_choice = input("Your choice: ").lower()
        if user_choice == "exit":
            print("Thanks for playing! Goodbye!")
            break

        if user_choice not in choices:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")
            continue

        # Generate computer's choice
        computer_choice = random.choice(choices)
        print(f"Computer's choice: {computer_choice}")

        # Determine the winner
        if user_choice == computer_choice:
            print("It's a tie!")
        elif (user_choice == "rock" and computer_choice == "scissors") or \
             (user_choice == "scissors" and computer_choice == "paper") or \
             (user_choice == "paper" and computer_choice == "rock"):
            print("You win!")
        else:
            print("You lose!")

# Run the game
rock_paper_scissors()

#### *How It Works:*
1. The user inputs their choice (rock, paper, or scissors).
2. The computer randomly selects its choice.
3. The program compares the choices to decide the winner based on predefined rules.
4. The game runs in a loop until the user types "exit."

#### *What You'll Learn:*
- Using random.choice for random selection.
- Comparing strings and applying game logic.
- Using loops for continuous gameplay.
- Basic program structure and input/output.
